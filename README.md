Project Overview

Relocating within this New York City can be really hectic and stressful, especially when you are obscure about a particular neighborhood. Knowledge of the community, local crimes, sanitation, noise levels during different times of a day is not readily available and requires quite a research.
To avoid any surprises and sour experiences, we have decided to come up with an application that provides such information along with ratings of the neighborhoods, on users fingertips.

We have built an android application called ‘Know Your Neighborhood’ which will provide information about the crime rate, noise issues, rodent, insect infestation rate, restaurants and other social venues.

Technologies used: Android, Google Cloud DataStore, Amazon EMR, Hadoop, AWS ElasticSearch.
